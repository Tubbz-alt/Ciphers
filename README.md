# Ciphers
An attempt to code some basic ciphers.

These will be useful to anyone learning Cryptography and just want to see some basic ciphers in action.

There will be only C files in this repository.
You can clone and compile those files.

And if you find a better way to make these work, or just want to add a cipher that is not here, just start a pull request :)
